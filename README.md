# Multimodal_Damage_Identification

## Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning solution to identify and categorize disaster damage based on social media data. The project leverages both images and text (captions) related to disasters to automatically classify damage types and generate informative disaster reports.

## Audience - Relief Organizations and Emergency Responders
Relief organizations and emergency responders often face challenges in quickly assessing damage in disaster-affected areas. Our solution aims to streamline this process by providing an AI-powered tool to automatically classify disaster images and generate preliminary reports, helping these organizations respond more efficiently.
